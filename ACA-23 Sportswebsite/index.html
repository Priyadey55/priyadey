                <h1> Biography </h1>
                <p>Suresh Raina born on 27 November 1986  is a former Indian international cricketer. An aggressive left-handed middle-order batsman and an occasional off-spin bowler, he is also regarded as one of the best fielders in world cricket. He plays for Uttar Pradesh in all forms of domestic cricket. He was the captain of the Gujarat Lions in the Indian Premier League, and is the current vice-captain of the Chennai Super Kings. He has also captained the Indian cricket team and is the second-youngest player ever to captain India. He is the first Indian batsman to hit a century in all three formats of international cricket.[6]
</p>
<p>Raina made his ODI debut in July 2005 against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. However, his Test debut came about five years later, in July 2010, against the same opposition. He scored a hundred on his Test debut. He was a part of the Indian squad that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup
On 15 August 2020, Raina announced his retirement from all formats of international cricket. He pulled from 2020 Indian Premier League due to personal reasons.

He has an older brother, Dinesh Raina. Suresh firmly decided to play cricket at the age of 14 and moved to Specialist Government Sports College.[13]
     </p>      
           <p>In 2000, Raina decided to play cricket and subsequently moved from his hometown Muradnagar, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh (near New Delhi) to Lucknow, to attend the Guru Gobind Singh Sports College, Lucknow.He rose to become the captain of the Uttar Pradesh U-16s and came to prominence amongst Indian selectors in 2002 when he was selected at the age of 15 and a half years for the U-19 tour to England, where he made a pair of half-centuries in the U-19 Test matches. He toured Sri Lanka later that year with the U-17 team. He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Uttar Pradesh against Assam in February 2003 at the age of 16 but did not play another match until the following season. In late 2003, he toured Pakistan for the U-19 Asian ODI Championship before being selected for the 2004 U-19 World Cup, where he scored three half-centuries, including a 90 scored off only 38 balls. He was then awarded a Border-Gavaskar scholarship to train at the Australian Cricket Academy and in early 2005, he made his first-class limited overs debut, and scored 645 runs that season at an average of 53.7
</p>
<p>In 2017, Raina did not manage to remain a regular fixture in the Indian team and was dropped from the Annual Retainership of the BCCI.
            2011 Cricket World Cup</p>
 <p>Raina was on the bench through the first half of the 2011 Cricket World Cup as captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni instead went with the in-form Yusuf Pathan. This remained so until the group game against West Indies, in which Raina played in place of an injured Virender Sehwag. Against defending champions Australia in the quarter-final, Dhoni made a strategic change, omitting Yusuf Pathan in favour of Raina. Raina responded by assisting Yuvraj Singh in a successful run chase through high pressure, making 34 from 28 balls to carry India to victory. In the semi-final against Pakistan, he batted with tailenders to score an unbeaten 36, a significant contribution to India's final tally of 260. He also took Younis Khan's catch off of Yuvraj's bowling. Suresh Raina played some crucial knocks in the quarter-final and semi-final of the World Cup, which helped India to win the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. Gary Kirsten, the then coach of India, said 'Raina won the World Cup for us with some crucial knocks'. [18]
